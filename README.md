## About me:
<p>I'm Liliia Tertytska. I'm originally from Ukraine, but now based in Poland, Krakow.</p>
<p>I decided to change my career from Accountant to QA Engineer. I'm wondering how fast tech industry is developing. And how huge step forward are doing those industries where IT joins. That's why I want to be a part of this creative community.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm completing my study at the IT Step Academy Ukraine, as a Manual QA Engineer. During this course, I also families the basics of automated testing. In my opinion it is interesting, and I want to develop as Automation QA Engineer in the future.</p>
<ul>Among my strengths, I'd highlight:
<li>self-motivation;</li>
<li>diligence;</li>
<li>attention to details;</li>
<li>non-conflicting;</li>
<li>work ethic.</li></ul>
<p>My goal for the future is to find an interesting job and to develop as a QA Engineer.</p>
